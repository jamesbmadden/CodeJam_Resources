# üèñ CodeJam Resources

This document contains a bunch of resources for CodeJam. Feel free to look through and get yourself adjusted to the content before the hackathon.

## üë∂ Basics

If this is your first time at a hackathon or coding past ECSE 202 or COMP 202, it's probably best that you learn some concepts that'll help ramp you up before!

- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - Interactive tutorial to learn Git, the most popular version control system for collaborative programming.
- [What's an API?](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82) - Learn how to use external services in your projects.
- [A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to HTTP and REST](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-http-and-rest--net-16340) - A more in-depth guide on how to use REST APIs.
- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - An in-depth series of tutorials to learn how to code in Python. If you don't know what language to use, Python is a good start!
- [Roadmap to Fullstack Web Development](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack) - Web projects are some of the easiest to make during a hackathon. Learn more about different technologies that are commonly used!
- [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro) - If you want to ramp up quick on machine learning.
- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) - A beginner-friendly prediction competition.

## üõ† Recommended Software

These are some recommended tools for general hackathon success:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Your favorite programmer's favorite text editor.
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - Easy-to-use Git GUI interface so you don't need to use the command line.
- [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/install) - Powerful Python tool hosted as a web app useful for writing and organizing Machine Learning code. Very visually appealing and great for running code snippets.
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) - REST API testing tool.

## üèé Boilerplates

Boilerplate code is your best friend for a hackathon! As these are time-limited events, you don't want to spend half your time setting up your project.

Here are a few examples:

- [Mega Boilerplate](https://github.com/sahat/megaboilerplate)
- [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter)
- [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate)

If these don't suit your usecase, feel free to look up other boilerplates online!
